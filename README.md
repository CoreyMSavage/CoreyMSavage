### :technologist: About Me :


- 🤠 Howdy, I’m Corey Savage, an avionics technician turned hobbyist programmer (perhaps an entry-level career programmer some day)
  
- 👀 I’m currently interested in hobbyist game development in Unreal Engine 5, DevOps fundamentals, browser automation with Selenium and porting DOOM to embedded systems
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++/Blueprints, Unreal Engine 5 interface/tools, Quixel Mixer, Blender, Clip Studio Paint and probably a plethora of other things
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything
  
- 💡 A problem that I'd like to explore with programming is finding an accurate way to measure "PD" (Pupil Distance) for prescription glasses lenses via an app/website (I recently ordered some glasses online and the lenses were terribly inaccurate when compared to in-person measurements)
